The SUIT template is a cerebellar-only template developed by the Diedrichsen lab (Western University). 
The template is based on the scans from 20 healthy, young individuals. 

Additional, we have developed a flatmap representation for data visualization. Note that this is based only on a outer hull surface appropriate for visualization of functional data - not an attempt of a complete unfolding of the cerebellum.
